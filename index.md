## Homepage
I'm a newbee in network field focusing on core router development and maintainance.
Here are themes and projects that I'm intested in.

## Themes

- Network Vritualization
- Software-define Network (SDN) and OpenFlow
- QoS

## Projects

### Class-base queueing (CBQ)

In this project, First, I'll try to collect materials about the principles and algorithms of CBQ.
Then I'll create a demo of this method by referring linux kernel.

#### Task Lists

- [ ] add cross-reference of my projects
- [ ] read papers of CBQ, see below for details.
- [ ] read kernel code of CBQ.

### Packet classification
In this project, First, I'll try to read 5+ papers about packet classification, each is a specific
method. Then, I'll do a summary of this top.

#### Task Lists
- [ ] read papers
- [ ] learn basic data structure and algorithm related to each method
- [ ] do a summary

### Token bucket
In this project, First, I'll try to summary the 1R2C, 2R3C etc. Then try to create a demo.

#### Task Lists
- [ ] summarize the method
- [ ] create the demo
